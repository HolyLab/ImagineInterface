# ImagineInterface
Read and write Imagine analog and digital recordings and commands

A work-in-progress, reading and writing of command files is implemented.  Need to implement reading of recording files (".ai" and ".di" files produced by Imagine).  As we work on this package we may decide it's worthwhile to change some of Imagine's naming conventions as well as what/where metadata should be recorded.

**Note:** Plotting capabilities have moved to the [ImaginePlots](https://github.com/HolyLab/ImaginePlots) package.
