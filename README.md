# ImagineInterface
Read and write Imagine analog and digital recordings and commands

A work-in-progress, reading of command files is implemented.  Need to implement writing of command files and reading of recording files (".ai" and ".di" files produced by Imagine).  As we work on this package we may decide it's worthwhile to change some of Imagine's naming conventions as well as what/where metadata should be recorded.
